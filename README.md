Bioscript is a synthetic biology language.

* __Embeddable:__ synbiolua can be embedded in larger programs
* __Modern:__ synbiolua is built for engineering in the modern day, from codon optimization to synthesis fixing.
* __Maintainable:__ synbiolua is built for long term stability and continuous testing.

### Directories
* `src` contains source code (written in [teal](https://github.com/teal-language))
* `build` contains lua code, generated from teal
* `spec` contains specification files (ie, test files)

### Building and testing

```
./make.sh
