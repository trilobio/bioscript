# Bioscript

Bioscript is a synthetic biology language.

* __Embeddable:__ bioscript can be embedded in larger programs
* __Modern:__ bioscript is built for engineering in the modern day, from codon optimization to synthesis fixing.
* __Maintainable:__ bioscript is built for long term stability and continuous testing.

### Directories

* `spec` contains unit tests

### Building and testing
